\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The goal of this project was to determine how well relative stress detection could determine when males 
experience stress. Using the 12-Fold Cross Validation and SVM model, the best results were 74.673\% 
average accuracy using $M_2$ as the trainer. This result proves to be a moderate indicator of stress 
when test subjects are exposed to the same environment. The results from each male leveed a small 
variance between them which denotes the consistency from the SVM model for this experiment.
